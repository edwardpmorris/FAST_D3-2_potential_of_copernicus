<!-- Copernicus and coastal zones --->
With an uncertain future that includes climate change, sea level rise and increasing coastal populations, being able to make informed policy decisions in coastal zones will be critical for ensuring the well-being of Citizens and the sustainability of economic activities.
Europe's flagship Earth Observation (EO) programme known as Copernicus (http://www.copernicus.eu/, previously Global Monitoring for Environment and Security – GMES) is designed to help meet these needs and has a strong potential to benefit numerous sectors involved in marine and coastal activities.

## What is Copernicus?
<!-- Define Copernicus --->
Copernicus is an EU-led initiative in partnership with the European Space Agency (ESA) that aims to aid decision-making in a world facing increasing environmental and socio-economic pressures [@science_communication_unit_science_2013].
<!-- Describe structure of Copernicus --->
The programme includes observation satellites with missions observing land, atmospheric and oceanographic parameters.
This space-component is comprised of ESA's five families of dedicated Sentinel and missions from other space agencies, called Contributing Missions.
<!-- Sentinel data will be free. How can that be? --->
In common with the NASA/USGS Landsat missions, access to Sentinel data is open, full and free to all without restrictions.
This decision, very much appreciated by end-users, is part of the strategy designed to ensure the long term sustainability of Copernicus. 
With the idea being that promoting reuse of data will generate new businesses and jobs, whilst providing consumers with more choice and more value for money.

Paramount to this strategy, Copernicus is more than just it's space component, it is solidly built upon three other equally  important pillars; in-situ measurements (ground-based and airborne data), data harmonization and standardization, and the provision of products and services to users.
These general services, some of which are already operational or in the pre-operational stage, address six main thematic areas; land, marine, atmosphere, emergency management, security and climate change.
In common to the development of all of the services is the concept of effective end-user involvement and continuous evolution, i.e., an approach similar to an "agile development process".  

## Towards innovative services tailored to coastal zones
<!-- Copernicus generic services useful for coastal zones --->
The pre-operational marine service (developed MyOcean) integrates in situ, satellite and modelling data to provide detailed, near real-time information on  marine physio-chemical variables at global, regional and local scales.
Marine and coastal meteorological and climate forcing data is available from the pre-operational atmosphere monitoring and climate services.
Also relevant for coastal zones, the land service provides detailed information on land use types, water bodies and digital elevation, and data suitable for rapid responses to emergencies is available from the emergency planning service.

<!-- Copernicus value-added services specific for coastal zones --->
The opportunities for synergistic development of these generic services to provide value-added, user-specific services in coastal zones are unlimited.
For example,  a marine toxic algal bloom early warning system is being developed for the aquaculture and fisheries industries that will contribute to food security/safety (ASIMUTH and AquaUsers).
Radar satellite tracking of vessels and oil spills (CleanSeaNet and ARCOPOL), allowing the identifying of oil pollution, monitoring of accidental spills during emergencies and the identification of polluters, is already contributing to improvements in maritime safety and environmental protection.

<!-- Importance of coastal protection/risk management --->
A sector of growing interest, where Copernicus can potentially make a real impact, is risk management and protection of coastal populations/assets.
Recent extreme weather events, such as the 5th Dec. 2013 storm surge that affected eastern England, Hurricane Sandy (2012) and Katrina (2005), as well as the recent severe flooding events in southern UK and the Danube, have firmly underlined the very real human and economic costs of coastal flooding.
Indeed, studies suggest that the future global economic impacts of sea-level rise and changing climate will be substantial [@hallegatte_future_2013].
Hence, assessing the risks and providing innovative solutions to mitigate exposure is a very valuable endeavour.

<!-- Projects looking at coastal protection/risk management --->
In response, a number of international and national agencies have launched specific policy initiatives related to flood risks and coastal protection, including the United Nations Environment Program, World Bank, Federal Emergency Management Agency and The European Commission.
In Europe, these have been shaped by projects such as Eurosion, Micore and THESEUS, to name but a few, and will continue to be developed by ongoing projects such as RISCKIT and PEARL. 

However, none of these projects have been designed to harness the power of Copernicus, until now that is, Foreshore Assessment using Space Technology (FAST, http://www.fast-space-project.eu/) led Dr. Mindert de Vries of the Dutch independent institute for applied research Deltares, has the ambitious aim of developing down-stream services using Copernicus to support cost-effective, nature-based shoreline protection against flooding and erosion.

##  Down-stream services to support nature-based shoreline protection

<!-- Using vegetated foreshores for protection against flooding and erosion ---> 
Vegetated foreshores, such as tidal marshes and mangroves, naturally defend against coastal flooding and erosion [@temmerman_ecosystem-based_2013].
This means natural coastal ecosystems can play an important role in reducing flood risks, and are increasingly becoming part of cost-effective flood defence solutions.

<!-- Why the need for FAST? which gaps will FAST fill? --->
The water storage and friction capacity of different habitats is related to their structural properties; for example large, woody mangrove trees have very different energy attenuation properties compared to small, sparse tidal marsh plants.
The position of a habitat type in relation to tidal elevation, does it occur in the low or high intertidal, is also critical to deciding its impact in different hydrodynamic scenarios. 
Together these factors help determine long-term sediment dynamics and thus shoreline erosion.

A number of studies have examined the mechanisms by which vegetation interacts with hydrodynamics, and in particular tidal marshes and wave attenuation [@shepard_protective_2011], however the critical biophysical properties of the habitats responsible for attenuation are not always clear and few have examined the protective function of these ecosystems under extreme storm conditions. 

<!-- The FAST service --->
Hence, although a large amount of information exists, translating this into a product that can be used in evaluating flood defence/coastal protection schemes is presently complex.
This is the essence of the proposed service FAST is developing, as explained by Mindert de Vries, Project Leader, "FAST aims to make it reliable and easy for end-users to include ecosystem engineering concepts into shoreline protection designs". 

<!-- How will FAST develop this service? --->
### The FAST approach
How will the FAST consortium develop this service? Well to facilitate the widespread implementation nature-based shoreline protection, we need to; 1) be able to understand the mechanisms by which different vegetation types interact with waves, storm surges and sediment dynamics,  2) map in detail coastal habitats at the appropriate spatio-temporal scales, and 3) be able to easily include this information in flood defence schemes. Hence, the FAST team, made up of experts in hydrodynamics, earth observation, coastal ecosystems, modelling and product development, are focussing on 3 major tasks: 

The biophysical characteristics of coastal wetlands need to be linked to wave attenuation, allowing standardised generic parameters to be used to predict the attenuation properties of different vegetated habitats. For this measurements of wave attenuation, led by Dr. Iris Möller, Univ. Cambridge, are being made in different marshes at case-study sites throughout Europe (UK, Spain, Romania and the Netherlands).

Techniques for the classification of coastal habitats and the quantification of biophysical parameters using the Sentinel satellites need to be refined and further developed. Sentinel 1 (S1, C-band SAR) and Sentinel 2 (S2, very-high-resolution, multi-spectral) have been selected as the perfect candidates to derive the array of parameters potentially relevant to wave attenuation.
The optical sensor on S2 will be used to detect vegetation presence, retrieve biomass and the density of the salt marsh vegetation. 
Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of synergy of optical remote sensing and active SAR to identify tidal marshes [@van_beijma_random_2014].
In the FAST project, such a combination will not only allow better detection of large-scale vegetation patterns, but also help to identify and map the structural properties of the vegetation needed to predict their effect on waves.
Intensive ground measurements of biophysical properties for validation of S1 and S2 products are planned at a each of the case-study sites.

The modelling team of Deltares, world leaders in the development, validation and continuous expansion of software, have the task of translating the biophysical properties derived from the Copernicus Sentinels into impacts on engineering requirements for flood safety infrastructure.
Deltares, together with the business internationalisation team of the Univ. Cádiz, will package all this know-how into a user-friendly, self-sustaining service (currently code-named MI-SAFE).
Key to this process is ensuring strong end-user involvement and a user-driven approach to product design, which is being coordinated by Gloria Peralta and Jose Sanchez, Univ. Cádiz, an expert in the creation of start-ups.

<!-- Who will benefit from Copernicus services in coastal zones? --->
## Getting the most out of Copernicus
The potential beneficiaries of Copernicus down-stream services tailored to coastal zones, such as the FAST service to aid nature-based shoreline protection, range from small to medium enterprises, such as consultancies and engineering firms, to environmental NGOs and governmental agencies.
All of which stand to gain advantages in terms of cost-reductions and efficiency due to improvements in data gathering and decision making.
Overall these benefits should be passed on to Citizens as increased value for money and improvements in safety and well being.
However, importantly, as stated in the Copernicus mission brief by the European Parliament "Copernicus should be user-driven, thus requiring the continuous, effective involvement of users, particularly regarding the definition and validation of service requirements", hence to a large degree it is up to the user community to help define the services they want. 

In the near future, growth in the availability of Earth Observation data is going to be exponential, thus maybe the only limit on accessing the vast potential of Copernicus to stimulate knowledge-based services in coastal zones, is the ingenuity of the Global Ocean Community.
