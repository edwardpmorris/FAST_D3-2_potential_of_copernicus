<!-- Copernicus and coastal zones --->
With an uncertain future that includes climate change, sea level rise and increasing coastal populations, being able to make informed policy decisions in coastal zones will be critical for ensuring the well-being of Citizens and the sustainability of economic activities.
Europe's flagship Earth Observation (EO) programme known as [Copernicus](http://www.copernicus.eu/) (previously Global Monitoring for Environment and Security – GMES) is designed to help meet these needs and has a strong potential to aid knowledge-based decision-making in numerous sectors.

## What is Copernicus?
<!-- Define Copernicus --->
Copernicus is an EU-led initiative in partnership with the European Space Agency (ESA) that aims to aid decision-making in a world facing increasing environmental and socio-economic pressures [@science_communication_unit_science_2013].

<!-- Describe structure of Copernicus --->
The programme includes observation satellites with missions observing land, atmospheric and oceanographic parameters.
This space-component is comprised of [ESA's five families of dedicated Sentinel](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/home) (Fig. 1) and missions from other space agencies, called Contributing Missions.
<!-- Sentinel data will be free. How can that be? --->
In common with the NASA/USGS Landsat missions, access to Sentinel data is open, full and free to all without restrictions.
This decision, very much appreciated by end-users, is part of the strategy designed to ensure the long term sustainability of Copernicus. 
The idea is that promoting reuse of data will generate new businesses and jobs, whilst providing consumers with more choice and more value for money [@sawyer_about_2012].

[Figure 1. The Sentinel missions mark a new era in Earth observation focusing on delivering a wealth of operational data for decades to come. The six different missions carry a range of state-of-the-art technologies to supply a stream of complementary imagery and data tailored to the needs of Europe’s environmental monitoring Copernicus programme.

Following this strategy, Copernicus is not only the space component, it is solidly built upon three other equally  important pillars; in-situ measurements (ground-based and airborne data), data harmonization and standardization, and the provision of products and services to users.

The general services provided by Copernicus address [six main thematic areas](http://www.copernicus.eu/pages-principales/services/): Land, Marine, Atmosphere, Emergency Management, Security and Climate Change.
The land and emergency services are already operational, the marine and atmosphere pre-operational, and the other services in the later stages of development.
Common to the development of all these services is the concept of effective end-user involvement and continuous evolution, i.e., an approach similar to an "agile development process".  

## Towards innovative services tailored to coastal zones
<!-- Copernicus generic services useful for coastal zones --->
The pre-operational marine service (developed by the [MyOcean project](http://www.myocean.eu)) already integrates in situ, satellite and modelling data to provide detailed, near real-time information on  marine physio-chemical variables at global, regional and local scales.
The land service provides detailed information on land use types, water bodies and digital elevation.
Meteorological and climate forcing information is available from the atmosphere monitoring and climate services.
Rapid responses to emergencies is also already available from the emergency planning service and further services such as the [European Flood Awareness System](https://www.efas.eu)) and those related to security are under development.

<!-- Copernicus value-added services specific for coastal zones --->
The opportunities for synergistic development of these generic services to provide value-added, user-specific services in coastal zones are unlimited.
For example,  a marine toxic algal bloom early warning system are being developed for the aquaculture and fisheries industries that will contribute to food security/safety ([ASIMUTH](http://www.asimuth.eu) and [AquaUsers](http://www.aqua-users.eu)).
Radar satellite tracking of vessels and oil spills ([CleanSeaNet](https://csndc.emsa.europa.eu) and [ARCOPOL](http://www.arcopol.eu)), allowing the identifying of oil pollution, monitoring of accidental spills during emergencies and the identification of polluters, is already contributing to improvements maritime safety and environmental protection.

<!-- Importance of coastal protection/risk management --->
A sector of growing interest, where Copernicus can potentially make a real impact, is risk management and protection of coastal populations/assets.
Recent extreme weather events, such as the 5th Dec. 2013 storm surge that affected eastern England [@spencer_floods:_2014], Hurricane Sandy (2012) and Katrina (2005), as well as the recent severe flooding events in southern UK and the Danube, have firmly underlined the very real human and economic costs of coastal flooding.
Studies suggest that the future global economic impacts of sea-level rise and changing climate will be significant [@hallegatte_future_2013].
Hence, assessing the risks and providing innovative solutions to mitigate exposure is a very valuable endeavor.

<!-- Projects looking at coastal protection/risk management --->
Indeed a number of international and national agencies have launched specific initiatives related to flood risks and coastal protection, see for example [FEMA: Coastal Flood Risks](http://www.fema.gov/coastal-flood-risks-achieving-resilience-together) and [The European Commision: Flood Risks](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/flood_risk/index.htm).
In Europe, these have been shaped by projects such as [Eurosion](http://www.eurosion.org/), [Micore](https://www.micore.eu/) and [THESEUS](http://www.theseusproject.eu/), to name but a few, and will continue to be shaped by ongoing projects such as [RISCKIT](http://www.risckit.eu) and [PEARL](http://www.pearl-fp7.eu/). 

Filling a specific niche within Copernicus, is [FAST: Foreshore Assessement using Space Technology](http://www.fast-space-project.eu/) led Dr. Mindert de Vries of the Dutch independent institute for applied research [Deltares](http://www.deltares.nl/en/), which is focussing on the development of down-stream services to support cost-effective, nature-based shoreline protection against flooding and erosion.

##  Down-stream services to support nature-based shoreline protection

<!-- Using vegetated foreshores for protection against flooding and erosion ---> 
Vegetated foreshores, such as tidal marshes and mangroves, naturally defend against coastal flooding and erosion [@temmerman_ecosystem-based_2013].
This means natural coastal ecosystems can play an important role in reducing flood risks, and are increasingly becoming part of cost-effective flood defense solutions [@han_winterwerp_sustainable_2014].

<!-- Why the need for FAST? which gaps will FAST fill? --->
The water storage and friction capacity of different habitats is related to their structural properties; for example large, woody mangrove trees have very different energy attenuation properties compared to small, sparse tidal marsh plants.
The position of a habitat type in relation to tidal elevation, does it occur in the low or high intertidal, is also critical to deciding its impact in different hydrodynamic scenarios. 
Together these factors are also important in determining long-term sediment dynamics and thus feedback on intertidal elevation.

A number of studies have examined the mechanisms by which vegetation interacts with hydrodynamics, and in particular tidal marshes and wave attenuation [@shepard_protective_2011], however the critical biophysical properties of the habitats responsible for attenuation are not always clear and few have examined the protective function of these ecosystems under extreme storm conditions [@bouma_identifying_2014]. 

<!-- The FAST service --->
Hence, although a large amount of information exists, translating this into a product that can be used in evaluating flood defense/coastal protection schemes is presently complex.
This is the essence of the proposed service FAST is developing; make it reliable and easy for end-users to include ecosystem engineering concepts into coastal protection designs. 

> [QUOTE FROM MINDERT: One-liner what will fast do?] "FAST aims to offer tailor made services that will help end-users to include nature-based solutions into coastal protection schemes" Mindert de Vries, Project Leader FAST. 

<!-- How will FAST develop this service? --->
### The FAST approach
To facilitate the widespread implementation nature-based shoreline protection however, we need to; 1) be able to understand the mechanisms by which different vegetation types interact with waves, storm surges and sediment dynamics  2) map in detail coastal habitats at the appropriate spatio-temporal scales, and 3) be able to easily include this information in flood defence schemes.

How will the FAST consortium develop this service? The team, made up of experts in hydrodynamics, earth observation, coastal ecosystems, modelling and product development, have 3 major tasks to complete: 

1) The biophysical characteristics of coastal wetlands need to be linked to wave attenuation, allowing standardised generic parameters to be used to predict the attenuation properties of different vegetated habitats. For this measurements of wave attenuation, led by Dr. Iris Möller, Univ. Cambridge, are being made in different marshes throughout Europe.

2) Refine and develop techniques for the classification of coastal habitats and the quantification of biophysical parameters using the Sentinel satellites. Sentinel 1 (C-band SAR) and Sentinel 2 (very-high-resolution, multi-spectral, S2) have been selected as the perfect candidates to derive the array of parameters potentially relevant to wave attenuation (Fig. 2).
The optical sensor on Sentinel-2 will be used to detect vegetation presence, retrieve biomass and the density of the saltmarsh vegetation. 
Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of synergy of optical remote sensing and active SAR to identify tidal marshes (e.g., @van_beijma_random_2014).
In the FAST project, such a combination will not only allow better detection of large-scale vegetation patterns, but also help to identify and map the structural properties of the vegetation needed to predict their effect on waves.
Intensive groundreferencing will be made seasonally at a number of European pilot sites (UK, Spain, Romania and the Netherlands) to validate EO data.

3) The modelling team of Deltares and the business internationalisation team of the Univ. Cádiz have the task of translating the biophysical properties derived from the Copernicus Sentinels into impacts on engineering requirements for flood safety infrastructure, and packaging all this know-how into a user-friendly, self-sustaining service (currently code-named MI-SAFE).
Key to this process is ensuring strong end-user involvement and a user-driven approach to product design, which is being led by Gloria Peralta and Jose Sanchez, Univ. Cádiz, an expert in the creation of start-ups.

<!-- Who will benefit from Copernicus services in coastal zones? --->

The potential beneficiaries of Copernicus down-stream services tailored to coastal zones, such as the FAST service to aid nature-based shoreline protection, range from small to medium enterprises, such as consultancies and engineering firms, to environmental NGOs and governmental agencies.
All of which stand to gain advantages in terms of cost-reductions and efficiency due to improvements in data gathering and decision making.
Overall these benefits should be passed on to Citizens as increased value for money and improvements in safety and well being.
In the near future, growth in the availability of Earth Observation data is going to be exponential, thus potentially the only limit on accessing the vast potential of Copernicus to stimulate knowledge-based services in coastal zones, is our own ingenuity.
